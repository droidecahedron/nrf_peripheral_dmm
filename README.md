## Software
> [!IMPORTANT]  
> You must complete the first lesson of the [Nordic DevAcademy](https://academy.nordicsemi.com/courses/nrf-connect-sdk-fundamentals/) for this workshop.
> 
> You must be able to build and be able to flash a blank application. If you do not have a DK, at the very least a successful build system is required.
> **These are large downloads and take a long time. Please complete before the workshop.**

# Hands on
## Goal and Progression Path
There are a few branches in this repo, here is the intended progression path for you as you walk through this workshop.
```mermaid
graph LR;
  main*-->adc;
  adc-->npm_powerup;
  npm_powerup-->ipc;
  ipc-->ble;
```
> `*` == your current location

## High-level architecture
At a high level, we will write an application for the nRF54L15 SoC  (using two ADC channels on the nRF54L15, one per regulator) to read the analog output of each regulator on the nPM2100, then pipe that data via a BLE connection to our mobile devices. 

So, a little BLE peripheral Multimeter. Using nPM PowerUP, we can change the regulator outputs of the nPM2100 PMIC, and see the regulator voltage measurements change on our mobile device.
